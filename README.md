# Work_Day_Scheduler

This project is a Work Day Scheduler. It keeps track of Current, Past, and Future hours of the current
day.  First the Day, date and time is  posted at the top of the page.  Then, the user enters data into
each block of hour between 9 to 5 and saves each block of hour. The information is saved to local
storage. If the page is closed, the data will automatically be reloaded to the appropriate hour. If the 
page is periodically updated, the hours will be updated as to current, past, and future.  To delete data
for a specific hour, just delete the data currently displayed and do a save and the data will be gone.

At the end of the day all the blocks will be gray, as they are all in the past, the next day, if you do
a reload of the page before 9 in the morning, all the blocks will be green because they are all in the 
future for that day.
